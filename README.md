# WeatherProject
A simple website to get the location from the user and display the current weather of that particular location. It is build using the Open Weather API. This was made for me to learn the concept of API calls, and how API helps to give data to the website. 


## How to use
Step 1. Clone/Fork the repo and make it availaible to your local desktops.<br /> 
Step 2. Set up a server by writing following in the Git Bash under the same folder where you cloned the repo:<br />
npm init (see the instructions displayed and make changes if you want(optional)<br />
Step 3. Open the cloned code in a code editor and then move to the terminal. <br />
Step 4. Install the dependencies required by writing the following code in the terminal: <br />
"npm  install"<br />
Step 5. Get your API key which you get from "https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys" after loggin in to their website. Enter it in the appid section of app.js (Line No. 16).  <br />
Step 6. In the terminal write-  <br />
"nodemon app.js" OR "node app.js"
